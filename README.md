# -SULLIVAN-S-GROCERY-INVENTORY-ANALYTICAL-REVIEW-Smart-Inventory-Optimization-at-Sullivan-s-Grocery.

 INTRODUCTION: A STORY OF SHELVES, SYSTEMS, AND SMART DECISIONS

Every day, shelves are stocked and restocked at Sullivan’s Grocery, a bustling retail hub that serves hundreds of customers seeking everything from fresh produce to pantry staples. Behind the scenes, however, lies a complex dance of logistics ensuring that the right products are available at the right time, in the right quantities, and before they expire. One wrong move, and the result could be wasted stock, lost sales, or disappointed customers.

At the heart of this dance is the inventory, a dynamic ecosystem that requires constant monitoring and strategic planning. But with over a thousand product SKUs spread across multiple warehouses and varying shelf lives, maintaining equilibrium is no simple task.

The management team at Sullivan’s Grocery began noticing a pattern: overstocked shelves for some items, while others ran out too quickly. High turnover products were not always the highest revenue drivers. Worse still, a growing number of products were nearing their expiration dates without ever being sold. These warning signs prompted a deeper look into the numbers.

This analytical review is the response. Using Excel-powered dashboards, KPIs, and pivot analytics, I investigated the inventory behavior, uncovering which products move fast, which warehouses are efficient, and which categories demand attention. By understanding what drives reorder alerts, how expiry risks cluster, and where turnover trends fluctuate, Sullivan’s Grocery aims to transform its inventory process from reactive to proactive.

This isn’t just about tracking boxes, it’s about telling the story of stock, using data to make smarter decisions, minimizing waste, and ensuring that the shelves reflect the needs of the people who walk through the doors every day.

CONCLUSION

As we close the chapter on this analysis of Sullivan’s Grocery’s inventory landscape, one thing becomes abundantly clear: behind every successful grocery shelf is not just a product, but a decision, a choice informed by data, trends, and timing.

From the moment goods enter the warehouse to the second they reach a customer’s basket, each step tells a story of efficiency, foresight, and sometimes, oversight. The analysis revealed powerful insights: how Fruits & Vegetables lead in volume, why Bread Flour tops the reorder list, and how certain warehouses consistently outperform others in stock management. We also uncovered vulnerabilities such as 206 products edging dangerously close to expiration, and the disproportionate volume of discontinued products still being reordered.

Through KPIs, pivot tables, and interactive charts, the fog of uncertainty gave way to patterns and clarity. What was once just data is now actionable intelligence. Inventory turnover is no longer a mystery, it’s a measurable pulse of the business. Expiry risks are no longer silent threats, they are now visible markers that spark timely intervention.

But this is not the end, it’s the beginning of a smarter supply chain strategy. With these insights in hand, Sullivan’s Grocery is equipped not just to react, but to anticipate. To not only stock better, but to sell smarter. To minimize waste, maximize profit, and most importantly to meet the evolving needs of every customer.

Because in the world of retail, the shelf is only as good as the system behind it. And now, Sullivan’s system has a story, one that’s driven by data, defined by insight, and shaped for smarter decisions ahead.

The next stage involved targeted exploration using pivot tables, KPI cards, and dashboards to validate hypotheses and uncover deeper insights. Visual aids like pie charts, bar graphs, and line plots were used to track reorder behavior, sales by value, and warehouse distribution.

Key Insights:

🔢 Sales Volume by Category

Fruits & Vegetables dominate sales with 19,361 units, more than double of the next category Dairy at 10,772. Beverages and Bakery are the least sold, with under 5,000 units each.

✅ Insight: Stocking decisions should prioritize top-selling categories. Low-performing ones need marketing support or reassessment.

📈 Yearly Turnover Rate Trend (2020–2025)

Turnover improved from 7,529 in 2020 to a peak of 9,991 in 2021. Slight declines were seen in 2022 and 2023, followed by a recovery in 2024 (8,631), but a dip again in 2025 to 8,059.

✅ Insight: Fluctuating trends suggest inventory turnover success isn’t consistent — further optimization and seasonality planning are required.

📦 Stock Quantity by Reorder Level

Fruits & Vegetables have the highest stock level (18,489), with only 331 marked for reorder. Dairy and Grains & Pulses also have significant stock and reorder levels. Beverages have the lowest stock quantity (3,822).

✅ Insight: Overstock in Fruits & Vegetables might lead to wastage; more agile restocking strategies are needed.

⏰ Expiry Risk Days

206 items will expire in 1,095 days (3 years). Other risk categories include: 1,825, 730, 365, and 1460 days.

✅ Insight: Long shelf-life items dominate, but planning should still address items with closer expiration windows (e.g., 365 or 730 days).

💲 Sales by Inventory Value

The SKU group 40094–50093 has the highest sales value at $8.43M. 30094–40093, 50094–60093 groups follow with declining values at $6.5M, $5.4M, etc. The group 94–10093 has the lowest sales at $990K.

✅ Insight: Significant sales are concentrated in specific product groups. These should be prioritized for restocking and promotions.

🏪 Warehouse Stock Distribution

20 Pennsylvania Parkway holds the highest stock (55,053), followed by Oakridge Lane (55,007) and Greedlet Street (54,956). Several warehouses are very close in stock levels, indicating potential balance.

✅ Insight: Top 3 warehouses are near capacity — redistribution or location-based demand forecasting could optimize this.

📉 Reorder Status

17,601 products are Discontinued, while 16,235 are in Backorder, and only 16,867 are Active.

✅ Insight: More products are discontinued than active — a serious inventory inefficiency. A reassessment of procurement strategies is necessary.

🏆 Top 8 Products by Reorder

Bread Flour tops the reorder list with 1,193 units, followed by Cauliflower (1,318) and Blue Paper (906). Pomegranate and Hoisin Sauce rank lower with 766 and 769 reorders.
